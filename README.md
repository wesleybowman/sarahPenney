**_Sarah's Project_**

First, get the zip file from [this link.](https://github.com/wesleybowman/sarahPenney/archive/master.zip)
Now unzip the folder.

The way to run:

**Windows:**

Put the file in the windows folder to where the data is. Double-click the DataAnalysis.exe and it should start. Starting for the first time may take a bit, but bare with it. Then, it will pop up a window where you input the files you want to be analyzed. The output files will be where the DataAnalysis.exe program is.

**Linux/Mac:**

You will need Anaconda for either Linux or Mac. Anaconda can be found [here.](http://continuum.io/downloads)

Once you have Anaconda installed, open up a python terminal, move to the directory where the DataAnalysis.py program is, and run it with:

```
python DataAnalysis.py
```
This will once again output the files where the .py program is.
