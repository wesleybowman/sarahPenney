Sarah's Project

The way to run:

Windows:

Put the file in the windows folder to where the data is. Double-click the DataAnalysis.exe and it should start. Starting for the first time may take a bit, but bare with it. Then, it will pop up a window where you input the files you want to be analyzed. The output files will be where the DataAnalysis.exe program is.

Linux/Mac:

You will need Anaconda for either Linux or Mac. Anaconda can be found at http://continuum.io/downloads

Once you have Anaconda installed, open up a python terminal, move to the directory where the program is, and run it with:

python sarah.py

Very simple, but takes more setup than with windows and the double-click.
